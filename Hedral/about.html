            <h1> About this Website</h1>
            <p> I have created this website in order to organize my notes, characters, 
                and general idea about TTRPGs. I hope that this will become a resource 
                for character/campaign managment for everyone willing to 
                use it.

                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <h4>How does West March Work? </h4>
                <p> Each session will be scheduled by a player. The game is an
                     "open-world sandbox" game. This means that the overall story
                      of the "campaign" will be loose. There might be an overall 
                      story to each session; however, that story will be given through 
                      more subtle means. The Sandbox aspect means that the story is formed 
                    through the character's exploration of the world.
                </p>
                <h4>How are parties formed? </h4>
                <p>
                    Parties are formed when a session is created. If a 
                    player sees something interesting that they want to 
                    explore, then they can create a session on Discord and 
                    claim what they want to investigate in the world. This 
                    can be anything. If your character hears a rumor about 
                    a cave where the acid pits change copper into gold, then 
                    your character can decide to explore that. The "Session 
                    Declaration" on Discord will be telling the DMs of the server
                     that the "Alchemy Acid Pits" is something that you are interested in. 
                     It is then up to the DM to create that area and
                     make it interesting for the session.<br> 
                    <br> 
                    A DM can then claim the session and begin preparing for it. ALSO, players
                     who want to join you in exploration, can sign-up for the 
                     session. The time and date of the session are chosen by the 
                     person creating the session. The player who created the session
                      can have rules about how many players are able to join, and/or a 
                      specific DM they want to run the session. When the time comes, if
                       there isn't enough interest (usually evident the day before),
                     then the player can reschedule.
                     
                     <h4>How Do I start Playing? </h4>
                <p>
                    Look at the surrounding areas that were given in the world. If there
                    are rumors you would like to explore, start there! If there is only a map,
                    talk with a DM you want to play with, perhaps they can create something for 
                    you/your group.

                <h1> The Incident </h1>
                <p>
                    The ship is 12 hours away from New Orleans Port. During character creation think about why you were in Barcelona, and why 
                    you are heading to New Orleans. Think about the people you are associated with and the people you might know on the ship.
                    The adventure will start on the ship, and may take several sessions before getting to land. The campaign will begin with a mystery on The Promethean.

                <h1> Themes of Urban Fantasy</h1>
                <p> <b>Cosmic Horror:</b> WIth the advent of fantasy in a modern setting, there are common issues with power imbalance with characters and the World
                    for example, any physical conflict that you find in the city of New Orleans will be intervened by actual police.
                Cosmic Horror is a way to bring danger and mystery that can be violently destoryed without legal consequence. It can also bring a foreign element of fantasy to the story.</p>
                <p> <b>Mystery Noir:</b> Another common theme in Urban Fantasy, this allows characters to play the role of investigator as they uncover conspiracy and mystery.
                It is common in the setting of Urban Fantasy, and will be common in this campaign. </p>
                <p> <b>Modern Technology:</b> Issue, or utility, this setting will take place in a modern time where the technology is the same as now. That means 
                your character will realistically have a phone, has access to the internet and so on. Use that to your advantage. I will be using it to plan a realistic story.
            Information that I access is accessable to you.  </p>

            <h1> The St. Marina Shipping Company </h1>
            
            <p> The company has strong and old ties to New New Orleans, back to itâ€™s founding. The company itself provides jobs and opportunities to the surrounding areas. They are the owners of the Promethean.  

                <br><br>  <b> Controversy</b> <br><br> 
                
                The company has found themselves involved in controversy with their latest shipping vessel. A fishing ship that had sunk near the horn of Florida. Everyone on board had sunk with the ship, 30 workers and 5 members of a filming crew who had agreed to document their travels for a documentary about sustainable fishing methods. Records of the final moments were broadcast to the Coast Guard, but there was nothing they could do. 
                
                Some believe that the sinking ship was a coverup to something more sinister. Some believe it was a fraud for insurance. The company just a year prior the company had established a plan for a then unannounced project. This mysterious project is believed to be the ship that went under near Florida.
                
                The company had gone to the public to acknowledge the tragic end of the ship, and even gave a large lump some of money to the families that were effected.</p>

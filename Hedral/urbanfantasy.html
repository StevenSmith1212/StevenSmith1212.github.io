                <h1> The Incident </h1>
                <p>
                    The ship is 12 hours away from New Orleans Port. During character creation think about why you were in Barcelona, and why 
                    you are heading to New Orleans. Think about the people you are associated with and the people you might know on the ship.
                    The adventure will start on the ship, and may take several sessions before getting to land. The campaign will begin with a mystery on The Promethean.

                <h1> Themes of Urban Fantasy</h1>
                <p> <b>Cosmic Horror:</b> WIth the advent of fantasy in a modern setting, there are common issues with power imbalance with characters and the World
                    for example, any physical conflict that you find in the city of New Orleans will be intervened by actual police.
                Cosmic Horror is a way to bring danger and mystery that can be violently destoryed without legal consequence. It can also bring a foreign element of fantasy to the story.</p>
                <p> <b>Mystery Noir:</b> Another common theme in Urban Fantasy, this allows characters to play the role of investigator as they uncover conspiracy and mystery.
                It is common in the setting of Urban Fantasy, and will be common in this campaign. </p>
                <p> <b>Modern Technology:</b> Issue, or utility, this setting will take place in a modern time where the technology is the same as now. That means 
                your character will realistically have a phone, has access to the internet and so on. Use that to your advantage. I will be using it to plan a realistic story.
            Information that I access is accessable to you.  </p>

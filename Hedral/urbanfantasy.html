                    The ship is 12 hours away from New Orleans Port. During character creation think about why you were in Barcelona, and why 
                    you are heading to New Orleans. Think about the people you are associated with and the people you might know on the ship.
                    The adventure will start on the ship, and may take several sessions before getting to land.

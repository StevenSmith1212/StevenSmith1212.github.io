                     <h1> Edophian Peninsula </h1>
                     <p>
                        The Edophain Peninsula was given to the Aekolos government after their involvement in a scorching war The climate is wrongly 
                        thought to consist of only dry desert, by the geography of the peninsula ranges from a silvery wave of dunes to rich southern jungles
                         to the northern Frost Edge Region.
                        <br> 
                        <br> 
                        Many people and cultures travel to the peninsula for travel, religious 
                        pilgrimage, or exploration. Many of those cultures have made a life for 
                        themselves in larger cities or have collected into communities 
                        around the small villages scattered across the region.

                        The land is further divieded into poltical regions:

                        <h3> The Edophain Block... </h3>

                     <h1> Edophian Peninsula </h1>
                     <p>
                        The Edophain Peninsula was given to the Aekolos government after their involvement in a scorching war The climate is wrongly 
                        thought to consist of only dry desert, by the geography of the peninsula ranges from a silvery wave of dunes to rich southern jungles
                         to the northern Frost Edge Region.
                        <br> 
                        <br> 
                        Many people and cultures travel to the peninsula for travel, religious 
                        pilgrimage, or exploration. Many of those cultures have made a life for 
                        themselves in larger cities or have collected into communities 
                        around the small villages scattered across the region.

                        <br> 

                        The land is further divieded into poltical regions:

                        <h3> The Edophain Block... </h3> 
                        is the location of the capital city of Edophia, a metropolis of stirring culture and tradition,
                        ruled as a Geniocracy.
                        <h3>Dwelyian Hallows... </h3>
                            is a region of religious significance, common are druidic rituals and surges of primal magics.
                            Those who worship the land, sun, and sky travel here.
                        <h3>Silikian Coast. ..</h3>
                            is the home to the largest trading city, Medzul. A home for traders, pirates, 
                            those looking for adventure. 
                        <h3> Eflynian Valley...</h3>
                            is a humble region home to few proud Edophian cultures. The good thing about the Eflynian Valley, 
                            is that nothing happens in the Eflynian Valley.
                        <h3> Torel Northlands...</h3>
                            Bleeding into the rest of Hashirr, this area contain colder mountainous ranges. Many Arcane Factions have
                             stakes here. Perhaps for research, perhaps for something else.
                        <h3> Halfyn Kingdom... </h3>
                            the largest of the polical regions. Ruled by a Dwarven clans, but home to many. This kindom holds traditions and values
                            related to the olde lands. Secrets that have rested for centuries.

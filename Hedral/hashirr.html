                        The land is further divieded into poltical regions:

                        <h3> The Edophain Block... </h3> 
                        is the location of the capital city of Edophia, a metropolis of stiring culture and tradition,
                        ruled as a Geniocracy.

                            is a humble region home to few proud Edophian cultures. The good thing about Eflynian Valley, 
                            is that nothing happens in the Eflynian Valley.

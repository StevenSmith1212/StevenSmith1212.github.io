                    <p> The project involved designing a database in 3rd normal form (3NF)
                         with a unique and user friendly UI/UX.

                    <p>  I, with two other team members,
                         designed a website for a mock crime watch organization in which
                         users can add local cases as well as search based on a "location" 
                         value in the database.
                         Users are also able to sign-up to volunteer for the organization. 
                         Filling the form will update the database live to include the volunteer's information

                        The goal of the project was to evaluate data from a local company to find patterns in stored inventory, 
                        by comparing the price and storage date of an item, and the likelyhood of purchace

                    <p>  
                        My project partner and I used Naive Bayes classification and regression, linear regression, SVM (Support Vector
                        Machine) regression and classification, and K Nearest Neighbor Algorithms at find a pattern. The data
                        used in the project was given to the class by NiSource, a regional energy company.

                        Given a fixed node matrix, my group had to design an interface to allow a user to input a "Starting Node"
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>  
                        From that "Starting Node" the program would use Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, and the Prim algorithm 
                        to navigate the graph and give back the lenght/weights of the optimal paths. This was done through the use of 2d Arrays
                        linked lists, and recursive functions.
